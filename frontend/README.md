# Skedulo Tech Test Frontend

## Question 1

- Create custom hook function to fetch data with Loading and Error handling
- Apply a delay of 400ms to wait for user type in the next character, this is to prevent submiting too many requests to server
- I didn't focus too much on the UI/UX in Question 1

## Question 2

- Used Promises to fetch data asynchronously and aggregate data with O(n) complexity
- I didn't sort the resource objects in the list by resourceId nor sort the allocations list by allocType. Considering the backend return in proper sequence.

## Question 3

- Fetched data from the API and rendered in the given responsive layout.
- I couldn't get the pixels from Figma, the styling is not pixel perfect.
